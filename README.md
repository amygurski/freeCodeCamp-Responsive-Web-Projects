# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

I started freeCodeCamp on 4/26/19 and obtained my Certificate on 7/31/2019. It's estimated that doing the learning exercises and these final challenges was 300 hours of practice.

This repository contains my solutions to the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects: 

1. Tribute Page
2. Survey Form
3. Product Landing Page
4. Technical Documentation Page
5. Personal Portfolio Page

These projects were a great opportunity to apply what I had learned so far in HTML, CSS, Visual Design, andy Accessibility.
