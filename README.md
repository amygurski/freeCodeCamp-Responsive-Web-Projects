My solutions to the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects: 

1. Tribute Page
2. Survey Form
3. Product Landing Page
4. Technical Documentation Page
5. Personal Portfolio Page

These projects were a great opportunity to apply what I had learned so far in HTML, CSS, Visual Design, andy Accessibility.

Here is my certificate representing 300 hours of coursework: [Amy's Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/amygurski/responsive-web-design)
